                <p>Being human is a <em>gift.</em></p>
                <p>Some never agree to this tho.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <cite>"Why am I alive? Why did I get born into this world? Against my own volition."</cite>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>Since time immemorial, the curiosity of man yet fails to be satisfied.</p>
                <p>Science invented as a means to know more, to see more, to learn more.</p>
                <p>Always striving to be at the peak of knowledge, reveals a fear nested deep within:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <cite>"I have to be the strongest"</cite>

                <h2>The Paradox of Knowledge</h2>
                <p>But what is strength without understanding? <mark>What is knowledge without wisdom?</mark></p>
                <p>Man fears <b>irrelevance</b>. To be forgotten. To be surpassed. To be... <em>ordinary</em>.</p>
                <p>So we chase:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Achievement after achievement</li>
                    <li>Discovery after discovery</li>
                    <li>Innovation after innovation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Yet the void remains.</p>

                <h2>The Real Enemy</h2>
                <p>Perhaps man's greatest fear isn't death, failure, or even obscurity.</p>
                <p>It's <strong>meaninglessness</strong>.</p>
                <p>The realization that despite all our efforts, all our science, all our progress‚Äî</p>
                <p>We might just be <abbr title="Specks of dust">specks</abbr> screaming into the void, hoping someone hears.</p>
                
                <details>
                    <summary><b>But here's the thing...</b></summary>
                    <p>Maybe that's okay.</p>
                    <p>Maybe the gift of being human isn't about being remembered or being the strongest.</p>
                    <p>Maybe it's simply about <em>being</em>.</p>
                    <p>About experiencing this absurd, beautiful, terrifying existence.</p>
                    <p>Even if just for a moment.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>So yeah, man fears a lot of things.</p>
                <p>But the greatest fear? <mark>That none of it matters.</mark></p>
                <p>And maybe the greatest courage? Living fully anyway.</p>
